# Pokédex App
- This Pokédex App is a simple collection of Pokémons.
- Each Pokémon is displayed on its own own card with its basic characteristics shown upon clicking.
- The details about the Pokémons are fetched from an [external API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/), therefore the app uses JavaScript promises with fetch statements.
- The App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Modals are used to display details about a selected Pokémon.
