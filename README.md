# Pokédex App
- This Pokédex App is a collection of Pokémons.
- Pokémons are displayed on cards that display a modal with details about each Pokémon upon clicking.
- The details about the Pokémons are fetched from an [external API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/), therefore the app uses JavaScript promises with fetch statements.
- The App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
